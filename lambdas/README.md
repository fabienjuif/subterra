# lambdas

These are functions that are deployed to AWS.

An util CLI is writed to help deploying these functions :
`yarn publish-lambda [--clean-all] [lambdaName]`

## TODO:

- Test serverless to replace our custom util CLI
- How to tests lambdas ?
- Env var
- clean up wsConnections when we reconnect
- add timestamps to tables
