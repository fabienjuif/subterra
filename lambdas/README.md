# lambdas

These are functions that are deployed to AWS.

An util CLI is writed to help deploying these functions :
`yarn publish-lambda [--clean-all] [lambdaName]`

## TODO:

- Use rollup to prepare packages (es modules)
- Test serverless to replace our custom util CLI
- Move all packages/lambdas in lambdas
- How to tests lambdas ?
- Env var
